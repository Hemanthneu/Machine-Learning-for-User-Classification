# Using Machine Learning to Classify Students and Predict Student Purchases

Welcome to the Machine Learning for User Classification project! This repository focuses on applying machine learning techniques to a classification problem in the context of user engagement metrics. We've curated a dataset with personally identifiable information stripped, allowing for a secure and insightful analysis.

Project Objectives:

Train and evaluate various machine learning models (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests) to predict user behavior.
Specifically, we aim to predict whether students will upgrade from a free plan to a paid one based on their engagement metrics.
Business Objective:

Predicting potential customers allows for targeted advertising and tailored offers, optimizing budget allocation and ultimately increasing company revenue.

Key Features:

Utilize a curated dataset with focus on student engagement metrics.
Apply multiple classification models to predict user behavior.
Optional exploration of data resampling techniques to address dataset imbalance.
Note on Dataset Imbalance:

While dealing with dataset imbalance is encouraged for a more robust model, it is not a mandatory requirement for project success.

Explore this repository to access code, data, and resources for implementing machine learning models in user classification. Enhance your understanding of user behavior and leverage predictive insights for strategic decision-making.
